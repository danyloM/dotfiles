# Danylo Malyuta's Dotfiles

## Description

A set of dotfiles and a setup script to hit the ground running on a vanilla Ubuntu-based Linux installation for C/C++ developers. The objective is to have a no-questions-asked, robust and fully automated way of taking you from a fresh install to a fully configured system on which you can immediately get to work.
