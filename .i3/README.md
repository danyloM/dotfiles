# i3 window manager configuration

This is my personalization of the [i3 window manager](http://i3wm.org/). I followed [this excellent tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4&list=PL5ze0DjYv5DbCv9vNEzFmP6sU7ZmkGzcf) to get started. To get everything working, you need to install using `apt-get install`:

- `i3`
- `i3status`
- `i3lock`
- `i3blocks`
- `rofi`
- `feh`
- `sysstat`
- `acpi`
- `compton`

You also need to manually install:

- [playerctl](https://github.com/acrisci/playerctl) by downloading the lastest release `.deb` file [here](https://github.com/acrisci/playerctl/releases) and installing using `sudo dpkg -i <filename>.deb`
